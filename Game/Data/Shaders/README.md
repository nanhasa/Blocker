Shader file extensions borrowed from glslang (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)

The applied stage-specific rules are based on the file extension:
.vert for a vertex shader
.tesc for a tessellation control shader
.tese for a tessellation evaluation shader
.geom for a geometry shader
.frag for a fragment shader
.comp for a compute shader

There is also a non-shader extension:
.conf for a configuration file of limits
